		<h1>Data-first design</h1>
		<p>The following resources are needed to develop the social media app:</p>
		<ul>

			<li class="outer-list">Users</li>		
			
			<ul class="inner-list">
				<li>E-mail</li>
				<li>Username</li>
				<li>Password</li>
				<li>Picture</li>
			</ul>

			<li class="outer-list">Messages</li>
			
			<ul class="inner-list">
				<li>Date</li>
				<li>Text</li>
				<li>Reference to the User who posted the message</li>
			</ul>

			<li class="outer-list">Following</li>
			
			<ul class="inner-list">
				<li>Reference to a User (the one that follows)</li>
				<li>Reference to a User (the one that is being followed)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This structure represents the N-N relationship between Users. A User can follow multiple Users, and can be followed by multiple Users. Having this table makes it easy to search for the following and follower's list of a particular User.</p>

			<li class="outer-list">Mentions</li>
			
			<ul class="inner-list">
				<li>Reference to a Message</li>
				<li>Reference to a User</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This structure represents the N-N relationship between Users and Messages. N Users can be mentioned in a Message, while a User can be mentioned in N Messages. This kind of structure makes searching for a user's mentions fast.</p>

			<li class="outer-list">Keywords</li>

			<ul class="inner-list">
				<li>String</li>
			</ul>

			<li class="outer-list">Hashtags</li>
			
			<ul class="inner-list">
				<li>Reference to a Message</li>
				<li>Reference to a Keyword</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This structure represents the N-N relationship between Hashtags and Messages. A Message can contain N Hashtags, while a Hashtag can be in N Messages. This structure helps to retrieve the messages that contain a specific hashtag fast. Instead of having a separate Keywords table, the String could be directly stored in this table. The disadvantage of doing that, is that the same string is going to be stored over and over again (instead of a simple id).</p>
